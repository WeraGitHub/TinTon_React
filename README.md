# TinTon 
#### TinTon Game is a memory-based color pattern game built with React (`create-react-app`). The game presents a sequence of colored buttons to the player, who needs to remember the sequence and repeat it correctly to advance. The difficulty level increases as the sequence gets longer. The game keeps track of the player's score, and there's a scoreboard to display the top 5 scores.

#### 2. Install Docker:

`sudo yum -y install docker`

`sudo systemctl start docker`

`sudo docker info`

#### 3. Run the container based on the docker image from DockerHub:

`sudo docker run --name tinton-container -d -p 3000:3000 weronikadocker/tinton-react:v1`

In order to create this image and push it to the registry, I have completed the following steps on my Amazon Linux EC2 instance:

1. installed Docker: `sudo yum -y install docker`, `sudo systemctl start docker`, `sudo docker info`
2. added Docker to our user group to not have to type *sudo* all the time: `sudo gpasswd -a ec2-user docker`, make sure you restart your ssh connection after that
3. cloned repo: `git clone https://github.com/WeraGitHub/TinTon_React.git`
4. navigated to the project folder: `cd TinTon_React`
5. created or used existing Dockerfile: `vim Dockerfile`
   
```FROM node:19-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

7. built docker image: `docker build -t weronikadocker/tinton-react:v1 .`
8. logged in to Docker Hub: `docker login`
9. pushed the built image: `docker push weronikadocker/tinton-react:v1`
